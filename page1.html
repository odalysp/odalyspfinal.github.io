      <h4>Information and Communications Technology</h4> 
            <p>Used for day to day activites ICT sending emials, using a phone, a tablet and other technolgoies like this. They are to increase the quality, performance, and interactivity of services used in a city. They are also meant to reduce cost, and resource combustion and also improve contact with residents of a city at city stakeholders. </p>

    <div class="col">
      <h4>Connected physical devices using the Internet of Things of Network</h4> 
            <p>Also known as IoT, these systems of technology are physical networks that includes sensors, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other systems using the internet. Through the data collected from these systems, that city sets out to improve infrastructure, public utilities, and other services in a city. </p>

    <div class="col">
      <h4>Geographical Information Systems</h4> 
            <p>GIS creates, manages, and collects different types of data. The data that is collected is also used with location data. It allows a starting point for mapping and different analyses of different industries. It can be helpful in understanding relationships, patterns, and information in geographical space. It allows for better management and more efficiency in decision-making. </p>

          <h2>Smart Utility Meters</h2>
          <p>This is an IoT device that attaches to buildings and connects to a smart energy grid which allows more managed energy flow.</p>

          <h2>Smart Transportation</h2>
          <p>Under smart transportation, different technology would be incorporated in systems like public transportation, car navigation, traffic signs, car plates. Smart transportation falls under this category because it uses data to provide vehicle planning, it is open to all who are in the cities they exist in. Transitioning to this form of technology would allow more efficient travel in cities, reduce congestion for cleaner aries, and improve overall living standards.</p>

          <h2>Smart Grids</h2>
          <p>Smart grids are helpful for the conservation of energy. Smart grids can monitor prower, and improve connections between different systems to create more efficient cities. Examples of smart grids include energy storage units and solar panels. These devices allow residents to store energy during off-peak hours. Implementing smart grids will support the newer infrastructures of cities. Using a smart grid can also contribute to carbon reduction and renewable energy goals that will be better for the environment.  </p>

          <h2>Smart Waste Management Solutions</h2>
          <p>Implementing waste solutions will use sensors that measure how much a container can be filled and will provide information to companies, and buildings when they need to be emptied. Given the opportunity to track waste it will allow cities to make changes based on the waste they are seeing. It can create more time efficient waste pick up in cites, and will also contribute to reduction in carbon footprints.  </p>
